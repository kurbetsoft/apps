<br/>
Intuition is the ability to gain knowledge without relying on logic and analysis. It is a sensation that helps us make quick decisions and navigate unknown situations without always being aware of all the details or facts.<br/>
Every day we are faced with choices, and often we base our decisions on logic and analysis. However, intuition can be a wiser advisor, especially when it comes to complex situations where there is no clear answer. Developed intuition will help us make the right decisions and avoid troubles.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Developing Intuition</b><br/>
<br/>
The question of whether it is possible to develop intuition worries many. Some people believe that intuition is something innate and cannot be changed. However, numerous studies and practice suggest the opposite. Intuition is a skill that can be improved and developed through learning and training.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Intuition Training</b><br/>
<br/>
One of the effective ways to learn and train intuition is through a game. Games to develop intuition help a person relax and focus on their sensations.<br/>
The intuition trainer "Intuit" is an application that implements intuition training in the form of a game to develop intuition.<br/>
When using this intuition trainer, you should feel which of the two arrows you should click on and select the correct option. When you press the button with the green arrow, the correct option is for the green ball to fall into the right section. And when you press the button with the red arrow, the correct option is for the red ball to fall into the left section.<br/>
This is a simple and straightforward game with different difficulty levels and the ability to track your progress.<br/>
It is recommended to train your intuition using the intuition trainer regularly, if possible every day, in order to effectively develop your intuition.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
